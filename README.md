Used to create paths for npcs on wow private servers.
Note: This software requires a parsed packet file to work.

## Login

When you start the program you will see the following window. If you have access to a database you can connect to it so the program can provide the creatures name for the entries you have sniffed. just input the data required to connect to your database and click ok. If save values is checked it will save your data so next time you use the software you will just need to click ok. Connecting to a database is used to display creatures names and is recommended but not required and if you do not wish to you can just click cancel.
